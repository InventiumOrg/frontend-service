# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for migrating the Inventium React/Vite application to Next.js. The migration aims to improve SEO capabilities, enhance performance through server-side rendering, and leverage Next.js's built-in optimizations while maintaining all existing functionality and user experience.

The current application is a TypeScript-based React SPA using Vite as the build tool, Material-UI for components, Clerk for authentication, and React Router for navigation. The migration will preserve all current features while transitioning to Next.js's App Router architecture.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to migrate the existing React/Vite application to Next.js, so that I can benefit from server-side rendering, improved SEO, and Next.js's built-in optimizations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the migration is complete THEN the application SHALL run on Next.js framework instead of Vite
2. WHEN the application loads THEN all existing pages SHALL be accessible with the same URLs
3. WHEN users navigate the application THEN all current functionality SHALL work identically to the original
4. WHEN the application builds THEN it SHALL use Next.js build system instead of Vite

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want all authentication features to work seamlessly after migration, so that I can continue to access protected routes and manage my account.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits protected routes THEN they SHALL be redirected to sign-in if not authenticated
2. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN they SHALL have access to all protected pages
3. WHEN a user signs in or signs up THEN the Clerk authentication flow SHALL work identically
4. WHEN authentication state changes THEN route protection SHALL respond appropriately

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing pages and components to render correctly after migration, so that the application maintains its current appearance and functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any page loads THEN all Material-UI components SHALL render with correct styling
2. WHEN the application initializes THEN the custom theme SHALL be applied consistently
3. WHEN components render THEN all TypeScript types SHALL be preserved and functional
4. WHEN data grids display THEN MUI X DataGrid SHALL function identically to the original

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the routing system to be converted to Next.js App Router, so that I can leverage file-based routing and improved performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users navigate to `/` THEN they SHALL see the Dashboard page
2. WHEN users navigate to `/inventory/explore` THEN they SHALL see the Inventory page
3. WHEN users navigate to `/inventory/catelogue` THEN they SHALL see the Catalogue page
4. WHEN users access auth routes THEN they SHALL be handled by Clerk's Next.js integration
5. WHEN invalid routes are accessed THEN appropriate 404 handling SHALL be implemented

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want all build configurations and environment variables to be properly migrated, so that the application builds and deploys correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment variables are accessed THEN they SHALL use Next.js conventions (NEXT_PUBLIC_*)
2. WHEN the application builds THEN TypeScript path aliases SHALL resolve correctly
3. WHEN linting runs THEN ESLint configuration SHALL work with Next.js
4. WHEN the application is deployed THEN it SHALL work on the target hosting platform

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the project structure to follow Next.js conventions, so that the codebase is maintainable and follows framework best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining the project structure THEN it SHALL follow Next.js App Router conventions
2. WHEN components are organized THEN they SHALL maintain logical grouping and reusability
3. WHEN layouts are implemented THEN they SHALL use Next.js layout patterns
4. WHEN static assets are served THEN they SHALL be properly configured in the public directory

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to maintain or improve performance after migration, so that page loads and interactions remain fast and responsive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN pages load THEN they SHALL render at least as fast as the original application
2. WHEN JavaScript bundles are analyzed THEN they SHALL be optimally split and sized
3. WHEN images are displayed THEN they SHALL use Next.js Image optimization when applicable
4. WHEN the application initializes THEN hydration SHALL occur without layout shifts

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing to ensure the migration is successful, so that I can confidently deploy the migrated application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all pages are tested THEN they SHALL render without errors
2. WHEN authentication flows are tested THEN they SHALL work correctly
3. WHEN routing is tested THEN all navigation SHALL function properly
4. WHEN the build process is tested THEN it SHALL complete successfully without warnings
